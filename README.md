# CloudWatch Logs to S3 Automation Using AWS Lambda

This project automates the process of exporting **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** to **Amazon S3** using an **AWS Lambda function** triggered by an **EventBridge Rule**. The Lambda function decodes and processes log data before storing it in the designated S3 bucket for archiving, analysis, or compliance purposes. This solution offers a scalable, serverless approach to automate log management with minimal maintenance effort.
